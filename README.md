# Tea Time
Tea Time is a relaxing iOS game where you can choose and prepare your favorite tea, from the comfort of your own kitchen! üçµ

This project was my submission to WWDC and won an award! üéâ

# Features
- Choose your tea: Select from three delicious varieties: green tea, white tea, or herbal tea.
- Prepare your tea: Use your device's motion sensors to pour the hot water from the teapot into your cup.
- Enjoy your tea: Blow on the cup to cool it down and then take a sip (tilt your device to drink).
- Calming sounds: Relax with the soothing sounds of lofi music and realistic tea brewing sounds.

# Instructions

1. Block the rotation of your device: This will ensure the best playing experience and prevent accidental rotations while playing.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions: The game guides you through each step with helpful hints and interactive dialogue.
3. Enjoy the immersive experience: The beautiful graphics and calming sounds will transport you to a peaceful tea ceremony.
